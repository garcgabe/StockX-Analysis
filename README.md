# StockX-Analysis
Analysis of StockX Sales Data

### Overview
Using a dataset released by StockX for their 2019 Data Contest, I examined sales data for both different types of sneakers. As an enjoyer of streetwear
and shoes in particular, it was fun to find this dataset and check out the price points and markups or popular brands and models. I used Python and
Jupyter Notebook to analyze the data and it gave me a good feel for how product sales analysis could be carried out. I wish I could've explored more about
the customers to help sell more sneakers. For example, how many are repeat customers? If a good chunk of StockX shoes are sold to a minority of their users, they're likely better off strategically marketing or selling to sneakerhead groups as opposed to the general hobbyist, such as myself.
